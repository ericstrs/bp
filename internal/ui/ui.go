// Package ui provides a set of interfaces and implementations for
// creating different types of user interfaces. This package aims to be
// a unified layer for interfacing with various UI types like TUI,
// WebUI, and GUI, while abstracting away the specific details ot each
// UI.
// This package defines a UI interface that all UI implementations
// should conform to. This allows the core application logic to interact
// with the UI in a consitent and decoupled manner.
