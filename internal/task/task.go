// Package task provides the foundational building blocks for
// representing tasks in various contexts such as TODO lists and kanban
// boards. This	package defines a Task struct that contains the common
// fields shared by all types of tasks, as well as a Tasker interface
// that specifies methods all task types must implement.
//
// The package is designed to be extensible, enabling developers to
// embed the Task struct into their own specific task type, adding
// additional fields and methods as needed.
