## Limitations

* Currently no third party integrations.
* Currently no collaboration support.
* Tree view does not support horizontal scrolling. Thus, a heavily nested board may run off the screen.
* A given child board may only have a single parent. This prevents two or more board tasks from referencing the same board.
